# SQHTML
The worst way to build a website

---

SQHTML is a server-side dynamic site generation framework written in ~30 lines of PHP 7 glue code and a small handful of MySQL definitions. It bootstraps your entire website into your database, leveraging the power of MySQL to implement a rudimentary templating language that can execute and display the results of queries directly in your HTML.

Disclaimer: This project started as a joke, and probably should have remained one. If you're really serious about using it, please for the love of all things holy don't use it for anything system critical.
